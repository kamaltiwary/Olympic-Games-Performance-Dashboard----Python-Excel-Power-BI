## 📌 Project Background  

The Olympic Games involve thousands of athletes, hundreds of events, and global participation. Stakeholders need **real-time, accurate, and insightful dashboards** to answer questions like:  

- *Which countries are dominating the medal tally?*  
- *What is the gender split in medal wins?*  
- *At what age do athletes typically achieve Olympic success?*  
- *How do different nations compare across games?*  

This project addresses these needs by integrating **Python-based Kaggle data extraction** with **Power BI visualizations**, creating an **interactive and professional Olympic Analysis Dashboard**.  

---

## ⚙️ Technical Process  

### 🔹Step 1 — Data Import  
- Dataset sourced from **Kaggle – Paris 2024 Olympic Summer Games**  
- Data fetched using **Python Kaggle API script**  
### 🔹Step 2 — Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python / Kaggle API)

**🎯 Goal:** Convert raw CSV files downloaded from Kaggle into analysis-ready tables (consistent country names, age groups, flags for medals, cleaned data types).

### ⚙️ Environment / Setup
Install required packages:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy kaggle
```
**📥 Download & unzip dataset**
```import kaggle, pandas as pd, os

os.environ['KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR'] = 'C:/Users/faies/.kaggle'
dataset = 'ploterim/panic-2024-olympic-summer-games'
download_path = 'C:/Users/faies/Downloads/Power BI_Imp Summary/Olympic/Source'

# Clear older files
for f in os.listdir(download_path):
    p = os.path.join(download_path, f)
    if os.path.isfile(p): os.unlink(p)

# Download & unzip from Kaggle
kaggle.api.dataset_download_files(dataset, path=download_path, unzip=True)

# Load CSVs
csv_files = ['athletes.csv','events.csv','medals.csv','teams.csv','venues.csv']
dataFrames = {f.split('.')[0]: pd.read_csv(os.path.join(download_path,f)) for f in csv_files}
```
**🧹 Cleaning steps**
```# Trim whitespace, uniform case, remove duplicates
df['country'] = df['country'].str.strip()
df = df.drop_duplicates(subset=['athlete_id','event','year'])

# Convert datatypes
df['age'] = df['age'].astype(int)

# Create Age Groups
bins = [0,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,100]
labels = ['≤20','21-25','26-30','31-35','36-40','41-45','46-50','51+']
df['Age_Group'] = pd.cut(df['Age'], bins=bins, labels=labels)

# Boolean flags
df['Has_Medal'] = df['medal'].notnull()
```
**🔍 Validation**
```
# Check for nulls
print(df[['athlete_id','country','age','gender','medal']].isnull().sum())

# Count unique athletes vs rows*
total_athletes = df['athlete_id'].nunique()
total_rows = len(df)
print(total_athletes, total_rows)
```
**💾 Export**
```
df.to_csv(os.path.join(download_path,'athletes_clean.csv'), index=False)
```
---

## 🔹Step 3 — Power BI Integration (Load & Connect)

🎯 **Goal:** Bring cleaned tables into Power BI with reproducible, automatable flow.

---

### ⚙️ Options

1️⃣ **Python Step in Power Query**  
- Go to: `Home → Get Data → Other → Python Script`  
- Paste your Python script (dataFrames will be returned as tables directly in Power BI).  

```python
# Example Python script inside Power BI (Power Query)
import pandas as pd

# Load cleaned CSVs from local path
athletes = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/faies/Downloads/Power BI_Imp Summary/Olympic/Source/athletes_clean.csv")
medals   = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/faies/Downloads/Power BI_Imp Summary/Olympic/Source/medals.csv")

# Return DataFrames for Power BI
athletes, medals
```
**2️⃣ Import Cleaned CSVs**
Use: Home → Get Data → Text/CSV
Point to athletes_clean.csv, medals.csv, etc.
Power BI will automatically detect schema.

**✅ Best Practice: Create a dedicated Date Table in Power Query**
```
Date = CALENDAR (DATE(2000,1,1), DATE(2030,12,31))
Year = YEAR('Date'[Date])
Month = FORMAT('Date'[Date], "MMM")
Quarter = "Q" & FORMAT('Date'[Date], "Q")
```
---

## 🔹Step 4 — Data Modeling & DAX (Relationships & Measures)

**🎯 Goal:** Model as a star schema and create robust KPIs.

**⭐ Schema**
Fact Table: Medals/Participation (athlete-event rows)
Dimensions: Athletes, Countries, Events, Teams, Date
```
Fact[athlete_id] → Athletes[athlete_id]  
Fact[country] → Countries[country]  
```
**📊 DAX Measures**
```
Total Medals = COUNTROWS('Medals')
Total Golds  = CALCULATE([Total Medals],'Medals'[Medal] = "Gold")
Total Silvers= CALCULATE([Total Medals],'Medals'[Medal] = "Silver")
Total Bronzes= CALCULATE([Total Medals],'Medals'[Medal] = "Bronze")

Male Medals  = CALCULATE([Total Medals], 'Athletes'[Gender] = "M")
Female Medals= CALCULATE([Total Medals], 'Athletes'[Gender] = "F")

Female Gold % = DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE([Total Golds], 'Athletes'[Gender] = "F"),
    [Total Golds], 0
)
```
**📅 Date Intelligence**
```
Medals YTD = TOTALYTD([Total Medals], 'Date'[Date])
Medals PrevYear = CALCULATE([Total Medals], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date]))
```
---

## 🔹Step 5 — Dashboard Development (Design & UX)  
🎯 **Goal:** Create three professional and interactive pages with consistent design, layout, and color theme.

**Page 1 — Country Performance**
- **KPI Cards:** Total Athletes, Total Medals, Total Gold Medals  
- **Visualizations:** Country-wise medal tally, year-wise performance trend, top 10 countries comparison  
- **UX Focus:** Allow users to easily see which country performed best and how trends changed over time

**Page 2 — Athlete Analysis**
- **Visualizations:** Gender distribution, age distribution, sports-wise participation  
- **Insights:** Analyze male vs. female athlete participation and success across age groups  
- **UX Focus:** Interactive filters like “Sport” or “Year” for customized analysis

**Page 3 — Medal Insights**
- **Visualizations:** Medal distribution by type (Gold, Silver, Bronze), top-performing athletes, country contribution  
- **Insights:** Compare medal trends and top achievers  
- **UX Focus:** Maintain visual hierarchy, ensuring charts and KPIs are easy to read

---

## 🔹Step 6 — Data Modeling & Relationships  
🎯 **Goal:** Establish logical relationships between datasets in Power BI  

- Clean and transform data before creating relationships using **primary and foreign keys**  
- Implement **star schema design**: fact table for medals & dimension tables for country, athlete, and event  
- Validate relationships to ensure visuals are accurate and responsive

---

## 🔹Step 7 — DAX Calculations & KPIs  
🎯 **Goal:** Create custom measures and KPIs for deeper insights  

**Examples of DAX Measures:**  
- `Total Medals = SUM(Medals[Count])`  
- `Gold Medal Percentage = DIVIDE(SUM(Medals[Gold]), SUM(Medals[Total]))`  
- `Average Age = AVERAGE(Athletes[Age])`  

- Implement advanced calculations like Year-over-Year medal growth and gender parity index  
- Highlight KPIs using cards and conditional formatting for better readability

---

## 🔹Step 8 — Interactivity & Filters  
🎯 **Goal:** Make the dashboard interactive and user-friendly  

- Add **Slicers** for Year, Country, Sport, and Gender  
- Enable **Drill-through** and **Tooltips** for detailed insights  
- Use **conditional formatting** and dynamic visuals for easy trend detection  
- Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes

---

## 🔹Step 9 — Testing & Optimization  
🎯 **Goal:** Ensure the dashboard is accurate, responsive, and high-performing  

- Verify data refresh and calculations for correctness  
- Optimize performance by reducing unnecessary columns and using aggregation tables  
- Conduct cross-browser and device testing  
- Final review for visual alignment, color consistency, and readability
